# Summing Game

## About the Project
This project implements an arithmetic practice game in Python. The game generates addition problems based on the chosen difficulty level, and the player attempts to solve them. The game provides feedback on each answer and calculates a final score.

## How It Works
1. The player chooses a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3).
2. The game generates 10 addition problems based on the chosen level.
3. The player has 3 attempts to solve each problem correctly.
4. The game keeps track of the score, deducting points for incorrect answers.
5. After 10 problems, the final score is displayed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/BernardoMarta/Summing_game

## Example

**Input:**
When prompted, enter the difficulty level (1, 2, or 3), then solve the addition problems presented.

**Output:**
The game will provide feedback on each answer and display the final score after 10 problems.
